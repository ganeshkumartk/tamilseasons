## Overview

**Tamil Seasons** is a responsive web application designed to visualize and explain the traditional Tamil calendar system. This system uniquely divides the year into six major seasons (‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ¥‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡ØÅ / *perum pozhudhu*) and twelve micro-seasons, deeply intertwined with nature's rhythms.

This project aims to bridge the gap between ancient Tamil wisdom and modern audiences, highlighting the cultural and agricultural significance of these seasonal observations. Explore how subtle changes in the environment marked time and guided life in traditional Tamil society.
